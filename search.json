    "text": "Will STAT 33B be offered in hybrid mode (both in-person and remotely, simultaneously)?  No, STAT 33B will not be offered in hybrid mode. Instead, all classes and sections are to be delivered in-person. If you have time conflicts with lecture and/or section, please don’t take STAT 33B this semester.\n\nWill there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?  Unless Campus authorities decide to switch to remote instruction, there won’t be live webcast or live zoom recordings. With that said, lectures may be recorded for archival purposes, but not necessarily be shared with the class.\n\nDo you have an illness policy (e.g. Covid, Flu)?  Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted either in this website or in bCourses. Likewise, you’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by office hours to chat with the GSI, the tutor, or the instructor.\nHaving said that, we expect you to attend lecture and lab. Past experience tells us that students who constantly miss lecture/lab tend to have a mediocre performance.\nAlso, missing lecture/lab does not give you the right to use OH as a replacement for receiving instruction. We are always willing to help you understand the learning materials during OH, but this also requires that you make an honest effort reviewing them before coming to OH.\n\nSTAT 33A or 33B?  You might be wondering what the difference is between STAT 33A and STAT 33B. Broadly speaking, the topics in STAT 33A are a subset of the topics in 33B. Please keep in mind that STAT 33A is not offered this Fall-2025 semester.\n33A is designed for people that have never programmed before, the pace of certain parts is slower, and more examples are provided. 33A puts slightly more emphasis on data analysis packages than 33B. The primary goal of 33A is that students finish the course with the basic programming skills necessary for a typical data analysis or implementation of a simple algorithm.\n33B is designed for students with previous programming experience (not necessarily in R). The curriculum assumes students will already be familiar with programming concepts such as variables, if-else statements, loops, and functions, so these topics are covered more quickly than in 33A. The extra time is used to cover details about how R works at a lower level. The primary goal of 33B is that students finish the course with the programming skills necessary to help developing and maintaining software in R.\nBTW: STAT 33B is not supposed to be taken after STAT 33A.\n\nI am a concurrent student. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?  Depending on the size of the waitlist, and the available space in the labs, you may or may not have a chance to join the class. For example, there have been semesters in which only 10% of concurrent applications have been accepted. Likewise, there have been semesters in which 100% of concurrent applications have been accepted.\nKeep in mind that the approval process for concurrent enrollment students takes place between the 2nd and 3rd week of instruction, and it is a somewhat slow 2-step process, which takes some days, and it involves not only my intervention but also the participation of one of the advisors in the Dept. of Statistics.\n\nI am a grad student officially enrolled. Do you have a grading structure for grad students?  This semester we don’t have a special grading structure for graduate students. All students will be evaluated with the same criteria. See the course syllabus for more information about the grading structure.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?  If you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at bCourses to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take STAT 33B.\n\nAre time conflicts allowed?  STAT 33B does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nI would like to switch lab sections with other student. Is this possible?  You should attend the lab section you are officially enrolled in. If you have a time conflict, then do not enroll in STAT 33B this semester.\n\nIs this course a good fit if I don’t have any programming experience?  No. We expect that all of you come with previous coding experience and be already familiar with concepts such as data types, variables, functions, conditionals, and iterations.\n\nIs this course a good fit if I already have some programming experience?  It depends. This course should be a good fit if you are truly interested in learning about R and its “behind the scenes”. Having said that, if what you are looking for is a general programming course, or a statistical programming course, STAT 33B is not a good fit.\n\nCan we work in groups?  Yes, absolutely. We strongly encourage you to not work alone. Well, let me rephrase that. You should try to first work on your own (trial and error). Take notes of the things you don’t understand. Then get with other people and discuss ideas, share tips (but not the entire solution).\n\nAren’t you suppose to teach us?  Yes. But you don’t learn programming by watching someone else program. The same way that you don’t learn to swim by simply watching someone else swimming. You have to get into the pool, and do all the drills your instructor says. This is a very hands-on course, and you will be required to do a great amount of work on your own.\n\nCan I ask you to write me a Letter of Recommendation (LoR)?  One-unit courses do not provide me with enough information about students to write a strong letter of recommendation. Therefore, I am unwilling to provide a LoR based on your work on this course alone.\n\nI invited you to join my network in LinkedIn. Why haven’t you accepted my invitation?  First: Don’t take it personal. It’s not you, it’s me. Second: if you really want that I become part of your network, why don’t you talk to me in person? We can meet in OH, or you can also schedule a meeting at a different time. Let me know you better than just as a distant contact in a social media networking site.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, we just don’t have enough human resources to have a dedicated Ed-Discussion moderator. We will do our best to monitor this tool once per day from Monday to Friday. Please note that we may not be able to monitor Ed during the evening nor weekend. That’s why we strongly encourage student participation on Ed-Discussion rather than answering right away (i.e. we want other students step up and answer questions).\nIn the past, some students have decided to use external discussion forums. When used responsibly and appropriately, we think that’s a great idea. But we have never endorsed their use, nor we have monitored, moderated or managed them, and we won’t do that this time.\nIn order to make Ed-Discussion a better resource for everyone, we’ve outlined some guidelines for you to follow when posting on this tool. Questions which follow these guidelines tend to have a higher chance of being answered!\n\nPlease adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.\nWe want to make sure that you are helping each other out, and having instructors give away the answers isn’t the most beneficial for your education either.",

    "text": "Keep in mind common rules of netiquette\n\nDon’t post irrelevant links, comments, thoughts or pictures.\nDon’t type in ALL CAPS! If you do it will look like you are screaming.\nDon’t write anything that sounds angry or sarcastic even as a joke, because without hearing your tone of voice, your peers might not realize you’re joking.\nAlways remember to say “please” and “thank you” when soliciting help from your classmates.\nRespect the opinion of your classmates. If you feel the need to disagree, do so respectfully and acknowledge the valid points in your classmate’s argument.\nRefrain from personal abuse. Don’t badmouth others or call them offensive words. You may express robust disagreement with what someone says, but don’t call them names.\nBe forgiving. If your classmate makes a mistake, don’t badger him or her for it. Just let it go.\nIf you reply to a question from a classmate, make sure your answer is accurate.\nBe brief. If you write a long dissertation in response to a simple question, it’s unlikely that anyone will spend the time to read through it all.\nRemember that your public posts are not anonymous. They can be read by your classmates.\nDon’t expect other people to do your homework for you. If you’re looking for technical help, for example, don’t ask questions you could easily answer yourself by reading the manual or help documentation provided with the software tools used in this course.",

Let’s assume you missed a quiz, for whatever reason. Do not write and say: “I missed a quiz. When can I make it up?” Instead, explain why you have extenuating circumstances, and ask the teaching staff if they will allow you to make up the quiz. Most likely you won’t be able to make it up, but at least you are asking in a professional way.\nIf you are unsure of how to write an email to me or any other professor, please consult this amusing blog post that gives you a useful template:\nhttps://medium.com/@lportwoodstacer/how-to-email-your-professor-without-being-annoying-af-cf64ae0e4087",

    "text": "🏫 Mode of Instruction\nThis semester STAT 33B is structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will gain initial exposure to new concepts before class (mostly in the form of slides and suggested readings) and then apply that knowledge through activities like discussions, problem-solving, and coding during class-and-lab time, as well as outside the classroom.\nBefore Class. It is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the slides sections. Optionally, you may want to review the recommended readings. Likewise, there will be ungraded practice coding exercises in case you want apply your knowledge or test your understanding of the weekly concepts.\nDuring class on Wed. Class time will be spent on live demos to illustrate R programming concepts with some small, yet real-life, examples. Do not be surprised or worried about not following the details of R code during class – that is not the point (furthermore, there will sometimes be code that is really specific to the instructional purposes of the lecture, e.g. to make a specific plot, and is beyond the scope of what you would be expected to understand how to do yourself). Commented demo files will be shared in bCourses right after class, or one day after class.\nDuring Section on Fri. Lab time will be dedicated to apply your knowledge by working through questions (in the format of printed worksheets) solo or in groups, and also to start working on the weekly coding assignment.\nAfter Section. You will keep working on the weekly homework (coding) assignment. These assignments are typically extensions of the examples discussed in lecture. However, assignments will sometimes ask you to learn about a topic related to but not covered in lecture/lab.",
